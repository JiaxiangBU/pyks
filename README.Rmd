The goal of `pyks` is to make a miniaml example to build a Python package. I learn it from @Albert_DeFusco2019.
The sample data is downloaded from @MORTGAGE30US.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `pyks` from [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/JiaxiangBU/pyks) with:

```conda
conda install -c jiaxiangbu pyks 
```

or the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```conda
pip install git+https://github.com/JiaxiangBU/pyks
```
